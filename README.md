# AV-LTFS2-Hackathon

Data science FinHack by Analytics Vidhya


# Problem description

In this FinHack, you will develop a model for our interesting business challenge ‘Business Forecasting’.

LTFS receives a lot of requests for its various finance offerings that include housing loan, two-wheeler loan, real estate financing and micro loans. The number of applications received is something that varies a lot with season. Going through these applications is a manual process and is tedious. Accurately forecasting the number of cases received can help with resource and manpower management resulting into quick response on applications and more efficient processing.
